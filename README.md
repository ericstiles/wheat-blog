Wheat Blog 
==========

[Wheat-blog](http://ericstil.es) running on an ec2 server.

## Documentation

Check out the [github project](https://github.com/creationix/wheat) for guides and documentation.

## Be Aware

The server.js needs to exist within the bare repository in order to pull the articles from the bare repository.  At this point I haven't thought through a work-around for this issue.
