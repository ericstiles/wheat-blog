# Lean vs. Big

Over the past several years I've enjoyed implementing various types of projects with an interest on
methodologies and technologies that support [lean development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development).
My day to day job has me focused on the eCommerce (or is just Commerce anymore) program of a major retailer.

There's an interesting dichotomy to provide thoughtful leadership that pushes for lean software development and still meet
the daily rigors of an organizational structure where various teams and their leaders have differing goals and
approaches to meet those goals.

# Today

## Clojure

At our firm the developers have a book club where currently we've started reading [The Joy of Clojure]().  I've been
spending some time with [4Clojure]() and [Clojure Docs]() trying to pick up the finer points of
[Homoiconicity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity)(treating code as data).

## NodeJS

As you can see with this site I'm working through my issues wuth NodeJs.  More to come...
